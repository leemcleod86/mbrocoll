        <p id="para1">MC Digital
Teesside’s tech scene is thriving. With over 7,000 jobs available across Teesside and the Tees Valley, the region has become a hotbed for digital innovation.

The future of society is digital and IT is now seen by organisations as a core element of business with the average salary of an experienced computing related job being £52,000. There are a wide range of roles available across the digital industry including Application Development, Web Development, Cyber Security, Data Analysis and Database Design. However, despite the breadth of jobs available there is now an international digital skills crisis and businesses are struggling to recruit these key digital roles.</p>

<p id="para3">Enjoying my current course of Level 3 Games Design and VFX. I highly recommend this college but don't expect a free ride you have to put in the hours and love what you're doing. Teachers are a lot more friendly than most secondary schools however I don't like Barry.
